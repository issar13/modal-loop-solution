# Modal loop solution
I was in a predicament when I wanted to manipulate a text box that was inside a modal. That was looped from database data. Each looped modal were basically initialized with the same id, form call out, so trying to make any changes to it and nothing was sticking.
After countless scouring through the internet and various solutions that did not seem to solve my problem I was stuck but with so much information in my hand I came up with this solution, albeit after hours of almost giving up on using looped modals. Check the commments to see how it works.
